## Key Features

- **Computational Photography**: Stacks multiple short-exposure photos to simulate long exposures.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Overcomes mobile hardware limitations through algorithmic enhancement.
- **iOS Development**: Built using native iOS technologies.

## Technologies

- Swift
- iOS SDK
- Computational Photography
