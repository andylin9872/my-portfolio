## Overview

Engineered a dynamic 3D brain optical model based on the Colin27 human brain atlas.

## Key Features

- **Brain Atlas Integration**: Based on the Colin27 human brain atlas.
- **Aging Simulation**: Simulated physiological aging by mathematically modeling cortical shrinkage and CSF expansion.
- **Signal Prediction**: Quantified regional degradation in absorption-weighted sensitivity to predict optical signal loss in aging brains.

## Technologies

- MATLAB
- MCXLAB
