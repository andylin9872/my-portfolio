I am currently a Master’s student in the Program for Precision Health and Intelligent Medicine at National Taiwan University, working at the intersection of engineering and medical science.

With a background in Biomedical Engineering, I have developed a strong foundation in translating complex physical phenomena into actionable medical insights. I enjoy working in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments where I can apply my skills in system integration and data analysis to create meaningful healthcare solutions.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been driven by a long-term goal of making healthcare more accessible and precise through technology. From organizing large-scale camps to inspire future engineers to developing portable screening tools, my focus has always been on how technology can better serve people. As a member of the Biomedical Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging Lab, I am now dedicated to exploring novel optical methods to enhance early disease detection and improve patient outcomes.
